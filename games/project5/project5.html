        <h1>Elements</h1>
        <p>Proof of concept for a game that revolves around combining different elements.</p>

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            I wanted to try out a game concept that would have the player combining different elements to create unique spell effects.
            Initially I was supposed to learn multiplayer and networking with this project but I quickly decided not to. Multiplayer is very heavy to implement later on
            and it should be taken into consideration from the beginning of a project, so instead I focused on other things like making spells and abilities their own configurable modules
            that can then be easily attached to any player or npc. Modularity is something that I had not done a lot before as my projects were not large enough to benefit from modularity.
