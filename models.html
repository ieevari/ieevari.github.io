    <h1>üßä 3D Models</h1>
    <p>Here are some of my interactive 3D models.</p>
    <div class="model-grid">
    
      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/garretace300i.glb" alt="Garrett ACE 300i Metal Detector" auto-rotate camera-controls
         interaction-prompt="when-focused">
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Garrett ACE 300i</h2>
        <p>A detailed model of my first metal detector. Created in Blender, textured in Substance Painter.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/turska2.glb" alt="Cod Fish" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Cod Fish</h2>
        <p>A Cod model prototype I made for a fishing game I worked on 2022. Textures were made with the help of Stable Diffusion, using an image from the internet as a source.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/mouse1.glb" alt="Robot Mouse" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Robot Mouse</h2>
        <p>A mechanical mouse I modeled to learn real-time IK animations in Unreal Engine. Textures were generated in-engine, so they can't be seen here.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/rover_final.glb" alt="Rover" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Robot Rover</h2>
        <p>Rover with triangular tracks I made for a prototyping track based movement in games.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/Suppilovahvero.glb" alt="Yellowfoot" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Yellowfoot (suppilovahvero)</h2>
        <p>Yellowfoot mushroom I modeled and textured using photos as a reference and by projecting textures onto the model. This was done before I learned to do photoscans but the result is pretty good!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/beeReady.glb" alt="Bee" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Bee</h2>
        <p>Bee made to act as an enemy in a group game project I was a part of.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/Swordman.glb" alt="Man" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Man</h2>
        <p>A character model with animations. Used in 2D graphics by rendering frame-by-frame into pixel art style.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/kanto1.glb" alt="Tree Stump" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Tree Stump</h2>
        <p>My own photo scan of a tree stump. Made for a game project. Game ready asset. Programs used: Blender and Agisoft
          Metashape.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/kasvi.glb" alt="Plant" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Plant</h2>
        <p>My own photo scan of a plant that looks like wild strawberry. Made for a game project. Game ready asset. Programs used: Blender and Agisoft
          Metashape.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/leppa1.glb" alt="Tree" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Tree</h2>
        <p>My own photo scan of a tree. Made for a game project. Game ready asset. Programs used: Blender and Agisoft
          Metashape.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/kivi3.glb" alt="Rock" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Rock</h2>
        <p>My own photo scan of a rock and surrounding ground. Made for a game project. Game ready asset. Programs used: Blender and Agisoft
          Metashape.</p>
      </div>
    
      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/jigi4_mold.glb" alt="Jig bait mold" auto-rotate camera-controls environment-image="neutral" exposure="1" shadow-intensity="1">>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Soft plastic bait mold</h2>
        <p>A custom 3D printable mold for inject molding soft plastic baits for fishing. This design worked well, but the plastic deteriorates fairly quickly.
          It's better to print the negative of the mold and make the mold from something more heat resistant!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/shrimp_mold2.glb" alt="Shrimp bait mold" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Soft plastic shrimp mold</h2>
        <p>A custom 3D printable mold for inject molding soft plastic baits for fishing.
          This bait was designed to catch Cod in Norway! (So far it has not succeeded...)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/upseerinNappi.glb" alt="Officer's button" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Russian officer's button</h2>
        <p>A neat metal detecting find photoscanned and digitalized. The button portrays a two-headed eagle. The factory that made these buttons shut down in late 19th century. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="model-card">
        <model-viewer src="models/kynsiastia_lowpoly.glb" alt="Container piece" auto-rotate camera-controls>
        </model-viewer>
        <h2>Piece of a metal container</h2>
        <p>An interesting metal detecting find photoscanned and digitalized. It is most likely a broken piece from container of some sort. </p>
